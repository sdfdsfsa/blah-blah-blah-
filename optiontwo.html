                the teacher that responsibles for your class picking process answer your question with vexation, for he has been having an attitude torwards you since the first day he sees you. He thinks you are the one who took his Barbie Doll when he was 14. When he sees you going to sleep again, he became too furious to hold himself back and he decided to beat you up. While you were getting beat up, your bladder exploded......
