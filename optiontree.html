                Throughout the school year, you found out that you should've listen to your teachers' advice and not take so many rigourous and challenging classes all at once. Transfering out, however, is no longer a choice. Therefore, unfortunitly, you are stuck with 6 Fs for the rest of your school year. By the way, your bladder exploded.
